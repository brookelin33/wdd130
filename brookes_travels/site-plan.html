        Welcome! If you are reading this then you are probably planning on going to Thailand! I had the opportunity to live in Thailand for 3 months at the end of 2023. One of the hardest parts of traveling is figuring out the best and cheapest ways to experience everything you want to! This website will hopefully give you some ideas on what to do, figure out the best places to stay and eat, and how to overall have a good experience in Thailand. 
        Where to go? Where should you even visit while in Thailand? There are so many amazing places you can visit in Thailand! Bangkok, Chaing Mai, Krabi, Sukhothai, Ban Mung, and Pattaya. Lets talk about my favorites and what I would recommend for anyone visiting these areas. 
        Bangkok: Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, there is so much culture, history, tons of people, and delicious food. While in Bangkok these are some of the things we did: went to the LDS Bangkok temple, walked around the King of Thailand's castle, ate at Chinatown, rode tuk-tuks, and went shopping at the Central Embassy Mall. 
        Chaing Mai: Chaing Mai was probably my favorite place we visited. Chaing Mai is very charming with lots of shopping and it's best known for its elephant sanctuaries! Chaing Mai had lots of yummy and charming restaurants, multiple elephant sanctuaries and amazing street markets almost every night! 
        Krabi: Krabi has the most beautiful beaches and the funnest nightlife. While in Krabi, we hiked to the tiger cave temple which leads to a beautiful outlook of the greenery surrounding the ocean next to Krabi. We ate nutella pancakes for $1 every morning, coconut ice cream at night, and yummy pad thai for dinners! We went to multiple beaches, with our favorite being Ao Nang beach which is just a ferry ride away! 
        Ban Mung: Ban Mung is a hidden gem in the northern part of Thailand that is not full of tourists and has a very unique beauty. There is a beautiful waterfall that locals swim around in that has multiple layers with pools at the bottom. We ate lunch at a charming sit down restaurant that looks out to the green mountains. What drew us to visit Ban Mung is being able to watch the bats come out of their cave at sunset. This was so unique and it is captivating to watch millions of bats fly out in a line with a beautiful sunset in the background.

        Where to stay and eat? For where to stay when traveling around Thailand, we always did hostels and we loved it! These are some of the hostels we stayed at and enjoyed. Bangkok: Niras Bankoc Cultural Hostel, this hostel is a great location, free breakfast, and helpful staff! Chaing Mai: About A Bed, this hostel was very nice, the owner is the kindest lady, and it is cheap! It is a little out of the way but me and my group loved it! Krabi: Pop-In Hostel, we stayed here twice! This hostel is nice, a 5 minute walk from the beach, cheap, and has a very fun social aspect. 
        For places to eat, you can almost never go wrong with the food in Thailand. In Bangkok we ate at Chinatown, Amritsr Sukhumvit Soi 22 had amazing Thai food, and La Monita had amazing Mexican food! China town is the cheapest place we ate and La Monita was a little bit more expensive but the serving sizes and food were worth it! In Chiang Mai, we loved eating at the Fern Forest Cafe, they had amazing brunch food although it was a little more expensive. We also loved eating at the street markets. If you stay at Pop In Hostel in Krabi, there is a restaurant right across the street called Saad Kitchen and they have amazing food for so cheap, we got all our breakfasts there. Lan Le Restaurant is right next to Au Nang beach, they have amazing burgers and fries. In Ban Mung we ate at a charming restaurant called Ban Mung steakhouse, which had both amazing food and views!

        Tips and Culture: Thailand has a very unique culture that can take a little bit of time to get used to. The Thai people are very kind and will never tell you if you are doing something wrong, so it is polite and important to know what their customs are so you can respect them. So here are some general tips for traveling in Thailand. 
        Take your shoes off when entering a home, or even some stores. There will often be a pile of shoes outside the doors and it is respectful to take off your shoes as well. Along with taking off shoes, it is very rude to have the bottoms of your feet pointed towards another Thai person. They consider feet to be the dirtiest part of your body and pointing the bottom of your feet towards someone can be very hurtful and rude. 
        When eating at restaurants, you will leave when you finish eating and just pay on the way out. It is not common to see waiters bring a check out when you are finished with your meal. You will go up and they will ask you what you ordered and charge you there.
        Modesty is very important to people from Thailand. It is important to be thoughtful about what clothes you are wearing. If you plan to visit any buddhist temples (which you will want to!) then shoulders, midriff, and anything above the knee will prevent you from entering. 
        A custom that I grew to love during my time in Thailand, is to acknowledge someone you will put your hands together in front of your chest and slightly bow your head. This is a sign of respect and acknowledgement. If you wave, you may get some funny looks :)
