  <h2>Tips and Culture: Thailand has a very unique culture that can take a little bit of time to get used to. The Thai people are very kind and will never tell you if you are doing something wrong, so it is polite and important to know what their customs are so you can respect them. So here are some general tips for traveling in Thailand. </h2>
    <p>Take your shoes off when entering a home, or even some stores. There will often be a pile of shoes outside the doors and it is respectful to take off your shoes as well. Along with taking off shoes, it is very rude to have the bottoms of your feet pointed towards another Thai person. They consider feet to be the dirtiest part of your body and pointing the bottom of your feet towards someone can be very hurtful and rude. </p>  
    <p>When eating at restaurants, you will leave when you finish eating and just pay on the way out. It is not common to see waiters bring a check out when you are finished with your meal. You will go up and they will ask you what you ordered and charge you there.</p> 
    <p>Modesty is very important to people from Thailand. It is important to be thoughtful about what clothes you are wearing. If you plan to visit any buddhist temples (which you will want to!) then shoulders, midriff, and anything above the knee will prevent you from entering. </p>
    <p>A custom that I grew to love during my time in Thailand, is to acknowledge someone you will put your hands together in front of your chest and slightly bow your head. This is a sign of respect and acknowledgement. If you wave, you may get some funny looks.</p>
